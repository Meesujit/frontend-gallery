# Drag and Drop Project

#### This project demonstrates a simple drag and drop functionality implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to drag items from one container and drop them into another container.

# Features

* Drag items: Users can drag the items from the first container to the second container.
* Visual feedback: The dragged item changes its appearance to provide visual feedback during dragging.
* Drop item: When an item is dropped into the second container, it is displayed as a new item in a column format.
* Reset functionality: The second container can be cleared, and the first container can be reset to its original state using the reset button.

# Technologies Used
* HTML: Provides the structure and elements of the page.
* CSS: Adds styles and visual enhancements to the containers and items.
* JavaScript: Implements the drag and drop functionality and handles events.

# How to Use

* Drag an item from the first container and drop it into the second container.
